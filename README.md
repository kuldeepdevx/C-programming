# C Programming Repository

This repository contains a **comprehensive collection of C programs**, organized topic-wise to cover **fundamentals, problem-solving, data handling, algorithms, and core programming concepts**.

It reflects my complete journey of learning C — from basics to advanced problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
